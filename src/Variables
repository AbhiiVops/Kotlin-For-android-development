 What are variables?
/* Variables are like names that are used to store data */

  There are two type of variables in Kotlin
 /* Var Variables : They are mutable, that is the data stored in them can change
    Val variables : They are immutables , that is the data stored in them cannot be changed*/

 1st way of writing variables

 Syntax : Keyword identifier = initialization
 var identifier = initialization
 val identifier = initialization

 2nd way of writing variables

 var identifier: Datatype = initialisation
 val identifier: Datatype = initialisation
