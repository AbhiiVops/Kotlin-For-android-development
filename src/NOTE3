Target to JVM, Kotlin is a cross-platform statically typed , general purpose programming language with type inference.
Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with java but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin is sponsored
by JetBrains and Google through the Kotlin Foundation

JVM - A Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java Programs as well as programs written in other
      Languages( Kotlin as of here) that are also compiled to java bytecode

Code written in Kotlin  --> Compiled to Java bytecode by the Java compiler --> JVM runs this bytecode and gives the output

Cross platform --> The code written in Windows can also be run in Mac OS and vice versa

Statically typed language --> They do type checking at compile time. This means that the language is able to tell the datatype
                              of any variable during the compile time and does not allow a variable to have values of different
                              data type in one program

Type Inference --> This means that the language can automatically detect the data type
